* Calculator

** Introduction
This is a browser emulation of a simple desktop calculator.

** Features

*** Arithmetic
The usual '+', '-', '*', and '/' are supported. In addition, square
roots, signed numbers, and percentage calculations (a simple
divide-by-100) are also supported.

Note that "chained arithmetic" is implemented, as described in the
[[https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator#assignment][problem statement]] (point #6): for example, typing ~12 + 7 - 5 * 3~
yields ~42~ in the display, with intermediate values being displayed
along the way.

*** Memory
+ M+
  - Add the display value to the memory cell.
+ M-
  - Subtract the display value from the memory cell.
+ M0
  - Set the memory cell to zero.
+ MR
  - Set the display value to the memory cell's contents.


*** Other Buttons
+ AC
  - Clears the display, and clears any buffered operand and operator.
+ CE
  - Clears the currently displayed figure. Buffered data is still intact.
+ =
  - If there is a buffered left-operand and operator, perform the
    operation using the displayed value as the right-operand, and
    display the result.
+ âŒ«
  - Treating the current display as an editable field, delete
    individual characters from the right.

*** Tooltips
Each button has an associated tooltip, available on mouse-hover, that
documents that button's keyboard keybinding.
